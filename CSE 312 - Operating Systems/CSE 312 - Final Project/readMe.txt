CSE 312 Final Project Read Me

This project is not implemented fully. The following are NOT implemented:
-Local/Global allocation
-Index sort, merge sort, quick sort
-Part 3 functions
-WSClock page replacement algorithm

The implemented parts are the following:
-Page replacement algorithms except WSClock
-Bubble sort
-Page Table and Page Table Entry structures
-Get and set functions
-Used a thread for filling the disk
-Used a thread for checking if the disk is sorted
-Used a thread to sort the first half of the disk with bubble sort
-Since the other sorts are not implemented the rest of the disk remains unsorted
-Printing page table in given interval
-Printing statistics of the threads disk reachs and read, writes.
